# Allocation Code Test

### This was given to me before I had any semblance of Java knowledge. This is my attempt at solving it.

### Requirements
- Developers warrant an allocation of $1000 each.
- QA Testers warrant an allocation of $500 each.
- Managers warrant an allocation of $300 each.
- Managers can have QA Testers, Developers and other managers report to them.
- Only managers can have people reporting to them.
- People will report to only a single direct manager.
- Departments consist of any kinds of employees.
- Users of this library should be able to:
-     Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a manager who has various employee types reporting to him/her. The level of depth of the hierarchy should be flexible ideally.
-     Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a department with various employee types under it at multiple levels deep just as the Manager can.
